Parallel is a simple 3D game inspired from ‘‘Thrust’’ in which the player pilot a rocket and need to overcome different sort of obstacles to reach the end of the level. I decided to base the game on geometric art and play of lights to improve my knowledge of lightmap in Unity. Through this project, I have also been able to enhance my comprehension of movement and physics programming a well as performance optimization.
