# Parallel
Descripton:

Parallel is a simple 3D game inspired from ‘‘Thrust’’ in which the player pilot a rocket and need to overcome different sort of obstacles to reach the end of the level. I decided to base the game on geometric art and play of lights in order to improve my knowledge of lightmaps in Unity. Through this project, I have also been able to enhance my comprehension of movement and physics programming a well as performance optimization.

Gameplay:

The player is teleported in 5 different rooms in which, several obstacles will be present. Obstacle can be found still most of the time, but from a certain level, moving obstacles appear increasing the difficulty of the game.

The goal is simply to reach the green landing pad on the other side of the room avoiding all the obstacles. Touching an obstacle lead to the destruction of the spaceship and the player will need to restart at the beginning of the room he is currently in.
